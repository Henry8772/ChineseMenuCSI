# ChineseMenuCSI

This repository contains the ChineseMenuCSI dataset, introduced in the paper titled "Cultural Adaptation of Menus: A Fine-Grained Approach" (accepted at WMT, Conference on Machine Translation of EMNLP). 

The dataset focuses on Chinese menus and supports research in cultural adaptation, particularly in the fine-grained translation and analysis of culinary terms across different cultural contexts.

In addition to the dataset, we will also release the code for the menu parser in the near future.
