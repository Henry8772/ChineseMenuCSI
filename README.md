# ChineseMenuCSI

This repository hosts the **ChineseMenuCSI** dataset, introduced in the paper [**"Cultural Adaptation of Menus: A Fine-Grained Approach"**](https://aclanthology.org/2024.wmt-1.120), presented at the **WMT (Conference on Machine Translation)** at EMNLP 2024.

The **ChineseMenuCSI** dataset is specifically designed for research in cultural adaptation, with a focus on fine-grained translation and analysis of culinary terms in Chinese menus across diverse cultural contexts.

We plan to release the code for the menu parser associated with this dataset in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!
