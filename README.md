# ChineseMenuCSI

This repository contains the ChineseMenuCSI dataset, introduced in the paper titled "Cultural Adaptation of Menus: A Fine-Grained Approach" (accepted at WMT, Conference on Machine Translation of EMNLP). The dataset focuses on Chinese menus and supports research in cultural adaptation, particularly in the fine-grained translation and analysis of culinary terms across different cultural contexts.
